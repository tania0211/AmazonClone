# AmazonClone
I'm excited to present my simple Amazon Clone, a project I've created using HTML and CSS. This clone faithfully replicates the visual design of the popular e-commerce platform, giving users a familiar and immersive experience.
The project focuses primarily on recreating the visual aspects of Amazon. Users can explore various product categories, browse through a wide range of items, and get a taste of the Amazon user interface.
It serves as a visual demonstration, providing an opportunity for developers and enthusiasts to explore and learn from the design elements of Amazon.
